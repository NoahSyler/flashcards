# Flashcards
Flashcards is intended to be a site for using spaced learning. It was running on a XAMPP server. However, now it is in docker containers. The XAMPP server was proving to be unreliable, and the docker containers have been an excellent replacemet so far.

This server is not open to the public. If in the future the website is exposed to the public, further security measures will be used. This is purely for a development environment.

There will be a total of 9 "bins." Each will represent the length of time before the next time the card will be studied. Every card starts in bin 1, then as they are recalled correctly, move up a bin.
